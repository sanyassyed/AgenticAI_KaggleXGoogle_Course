### 🧩 Core Components

| **Component**                                          | **Role**                             | **Description**                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model (Brain / Reasoning)**                          | LLM (manages context and reasoning)  | Thinks, plans, and decides what to do next based on input and memory.                                                                             |
| **Tools (Hands)**                                      | APIs, Vector stores, SQL, Web access | Extend the model’s capability to interact with the outside world.                                                                                 |
| **Orchestration (Coordinator / Conductor / Governor)** | Manages flow                         | Calls the tools, feeds results back to the model, and decides when to think, act, or wait. Often managed via frameworks like LangChain or CrewAI. |

### ⚙️ REACT

* **Meaning:** Reasoning + Acting
* **Goal:** Execute a mission through a **Chain of Thought**

**Cycle:**

1. **Think** — Model reasons or plans a step
2. **Act** — Executes a tool or API call
3. **Observe** — Collects results or environment feedback
4. **Repeat** — Continues reasoning until task completion

> 🔁 *ReACT alternates between reasoning and acting to ensure transparent, explainable decision-making.*

---

### 📏 Key Metrics

* **Security**
* **Quality**
* **Reliability**

---

### 🧠 System Concepts

1. **Anatomy:** Model + Tools + Orchestration
2. **Taxonomy:** Simple agent system → Multi-agent system
3. **Architectural Design:** How components connect and interact
4. **Building for Production:** Secure, scalable, and observable

**Lifecycle:** Build → Deploy → Manage an Agent

---

### 🧭 Agentic Systems

* Agents **plan and act** independently using reasoning and tools.
* **Tool outputs** are appended to the context (prompt) for the next reasoning step.

---

### 🔁 5-Step Operational Loop

1. **Get the Mission** — Identify the task
2. **Scan the Scene** — Gather data, identify gaps or resources
3. **Think it Through** — Plan a reasoning path
4. **Take Action** — Execute chosen tools or actions
5. **Observe & Iterate** — Learn from feedback and improve

---

### 🧮 Taxonomy of Agentic Systems

*(How complex should the agent be?)*

|   **Level** | **Description**                  | **Notes**                | **Example**                              |
| ----------: | -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Level 0** | Core Reasoning System            | No tools (“no hands”)    | Pure reasoning — model only              |
| **Level 1** | Connected Problem Solver         | Uses RAG or APIs         | Get current weather info                 |
| **Level 2** | Strategic Problem Solver         | Context engineering      | Suggest best coffee shop between 2 areas |
| **Level 3** | Collaborative Multi-Agent System | Manager–Specialist model | Project Manager Agent with sub-agents    |
| **Level 4** | *Self-Evolving Agents*           | *(Future concept)*       | Agents that self-improve over time       |

### 🏗️ Architectural Design

#### 🧩 Model

* **Superior reasoning**
* **Reliable tool use**
* **Optimized for quality, speed, and cost**
  → *Test models for task suitability.*

**Model Routing Strategy:**
Route each agent’s request to the **most appropriate model** based on performance, cost, and modality.

**Examples:**

* Gemini 2.5 Pro
* Gemini 2.5 Flash
* Gemini Live Model
* Cloud Vision API
* Speech-to-Text API

**AgentOps:**

* Build agents that can be upgraded easily using **CI/CD** practices.

---

#### 🧰 Tools for Retrieval & Action

##### 🔍 Retrieval Tools

* **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Vector DB or knowledge graphs
* **Natural Language to SQL:** Allows agents to query databases

##### ⚙️ Action Tools

* **APIs:** Execute actions (e.g., search, send email)
* **HITL (Human in the Loop):** Human feedback via SMS or UI

##### **Function Calling:**
* For an agent to reliably do “function calling” and use tools, it needs clear instructions, secure connections, and orchestration.
* Fuction calling can be done via **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — open standard for connecting AI to external systems
* Can be implemented using **ADK (Agent Development Kit)** or similar frameworks

---

#### The Orchestration Layer
##### Core Design Choices
##### Instruct with Domain Knowledge and Persona
##### Augment with Context
* **Purpose:** Augment the agent with context and persona

| **Type**              | **Function**                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Short-term memory** | Scratchpad for immediate actions and observations |
| **Long-term memory**  | Persistent storage (e.g., via RAG and vector DBs) |


##### 🕸️ Multi-Agent System Design Patterns

**Coordinator Pattern:**

* **Manager Agent:** Oversees process and delegates work
* **Specialist Agents:** Handle domain-specific subtasks

---

### 🧪 Testing & Debugging

* **FMOps (Foundation Model Ops):**
  * Manage and monitor large models efficiently.
  * Includes evaluation, versioning, and deployment.

* 🔧 Agent Ops
  * Evaluate agent performance and reasoning quality using another LLM (*LLM-as-a-judge*).
  * Use telemetry and benchmarks for human validation.

---

### 💬 Key Terminologies

* **Interoperability:** The ability of different systems and applications to communicate and work together effectively.
* **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — open standard for connecting AI to external systems
* **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** - a flexible and modular framework for developing and deploying AI agents

### Introduction: Models, Tools and Agents 
* Tools become the eyes and hands of the foundation models

###  Agent Tools vs Sub-Agents: What's the Difference?
This is a common question! Both involve using multiple agents, but they work very differently:

Agent Tools (what we're using):

Agent A calls Agent B as a tool
Agent B's response goes back to Agent A
Agent A stays in control and continues the conversation
Use case: Delegation for specific tasks (like calculations)
Sub-Agents (different pattern):

Agent A transfers control completely to Agent B
Agent B takes over and handles all future user input
Agent A is out of the loop
Use case: Handoff to specialists (like customer support tiers)
In our currency example: We want the currency agent to get calculation results and continue working with them, so we use Agent Tools, not sub-agents.
